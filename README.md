# CMS-System - very early stage of project
- it is not working yet!
- I am working on it alone and updating master directly (this is going to change in future after first functioning version);

I use this project to learn by trial and error. I am not profesional programmer so I hope I could get some great advices. 
I am planing to comment more in future. For now I am focused on getting the first functioning version out.


For now:
- Class Session - moved to DB
- Class Mysqli - prepared statements
- Class Accounts - simple login

Working on:
- Class Filemanager;
- Directives for Filemanager;

TO DO:
ALMOST EVERYTHING
